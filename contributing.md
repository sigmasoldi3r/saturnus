## Contributing

There is not much defined at the moment, but you can open up issues and pull
requests in order to contribute to some of the items of the lists below.

At the current state of development, things can be messy and bad documented. If
you wish to contribute but that is a barrier, feel free to open an issue asking
for clarification (Ie: X should need more examples).

Remember to add yourself to the list of contributors if you open up a PR!
